App Store Description

Eggy - The easiest egg timer ever!
Choose between soft / medium / hard and your timer is set.
No configuration, no extra buttons, just an egg timer.
If backgrounded, the app sends a notification when your eggs are ready.

Made by the creators of Easy Annotate (the easy way to annotate two pdfs side-by-side).
We we're looking for a simple timer for our lunch eggs, and found none.
So we build one ourselves. 

Hope you enjoy it as much as we do :D
Bon App√©tit!
