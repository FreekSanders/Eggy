Eggy Timer - Simple iOS Egg Timer

This is the source code for our small test app written in Objective-C.
It shows how to create a simple egg timer that is fully functional.

It's also available on the [Apple App Store] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eggy-the-easy-egg-timer/id970402018?ls=1&mt=8)

## App Store Description

Eggy - The easiest egg timer ever!
Choose between soft / medium / hard and your timer is set.
No configuration, no extra buttons, just an egg timer.
If backgrounded, the app sends a notification when your eggs are ready.

Made by the creators of Easy Annotate (the easy way to annotate two pdfs side-by-side).
We we're looking for a simple timer for our lunch eggs, and found none.
So we build one ourselves. 

Hope you enjoy it as much as we do :D
Bon App√©tit!
